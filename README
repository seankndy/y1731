Daemon written in PHP to poll Y.1731 data.  Currently only Telco BiNOS and BiNOX devices are tested/supported, but support for other vendors should be easily implementable.

This source integrates with 'circuitsmngr' database, but it would be very simple to tweak the queries to source the Y.1731 monitor data from any DB.
